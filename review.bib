	abstract = {The WKB method has been used to develop an approximate solutionof the semi-geostrophic Ekman boundary layer with height-dependenteddy viscosity and a baroclinic pressure field. The approximate solutionretains the same simple form as the classical Ekman solution. Behavioursof the approximate solution are discussed for different eddy viscosityand the pressure systems. These features show that wind structure inthe semi-geostrophic Ekman boundary layer depends on the interactionbetween the inertial acceleration, variable eddy viscosity and baroclinicpressure gradient. Anticyclonic shear has an acceleration effect on theair motion in the boundary layer, while cyclonic shear has a decelerationeffect. Decreasing pressure gradient with height results in a super-geostrophicpeak in the wind speed profile, however the increasing pressure gradient withheight may remove the peak. Anticyclonic shear and decreasing the variableeddy viscosity with height has an enhanced effect on the peak. Variable eddy viscosity and inertial acceleration has an important role in thedivergence and vorticity in the boundary layer and the vertical motion at the top of the boundary layer that is called Ekman pumping. Compared to the constanteddy viscosity case, the variable eddy diffusivity reduces the absolute value ofEkman pumping, especially in the case of eddy viscosity initially increasing with height. The difference in the Ekman pumping produced by different eddy diffusivity assumptions is intensified in anticyclonic flow and reduced in cyclonic flow.},

	abstract = {By animal experiments and clinically we could prove that isoglaucon instillation caused the decrease in IOP due to both increase in outflow and reduction of humor secretion; the IOP decrease and changes in hydrodynamics being manifested more markedly in the fellow-eye. As reoophthalmography demonstrated "Isoglaucon" produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract. "Isoglaucon" was prescribed to 20 patients having open-angle-glaucoma, Two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes (of 28) by 9.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. When prescribed regularly "Isoglaucon" raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.20 +/-0.02. The secretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.15. Thus, IOP decrease after "Isoglaucon" is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion. The "isoglucon" instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure, though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10 km and 100 km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20{\textdegree} ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 6 km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10 km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2{\textendash}1 m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 0.57 K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project.},

	abstract = {The rationale for publishing a second edition of this monograph is that this area of research continues to show remarkable advancement. The new generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites provided unprecedented spatial resolution of the sea surface features. In addition, satellites to measure sea surface salinity have been launched. Computational fluid dynamic models open new opportunities in understanding the processes in the near-surface layer of the ocean and their visibility from space. Passive acoustic methods for monitoring short surface waves have significantly progressed. Estimation of the errors in satellite measurements of long-term global sea surface temperature trends due to processes in the near-surface layer of the ocean has become important for climate research. Due to growing applications of the results, it is anticipated that more students are going to be trained in this area of research. Therefore this second edition of the monograph is closer to a textbook format},

	abstract = {AbstractA submesoscale filament of dense water in the oceanic surface layer can undergo frontogenesis with a secondary circulation that has a surface horizontal convergence and downwelling in its center. This occurs either due to mesoscale straining deformation or due to the surface boundary layer turbulence that causes vertical eddy momentum flux divergence or, more briefly, vertical momentum mixing. In the latter case the circulation approximately has a linear horizontal momentum balance among the baroclinic pressure gradient, Coriolis force, and vertical momentum mixing, i.e., a turbulent thermal wind. The frontogenetic evolution induced by the turbulent mixing sharpens the transverse gradient of the longitudinal velocity (i.e., it increases the vertical vorticity) through convergent advection by the secondary circulation. In an approximate model based on the turbulent thermal wind, the central vorticity approaches a finite-time singularity, and in a more general hydrostatic model the central vorticity and horizontal convergence are amplified by shrinking the transverse scale to near the model{\textquoteright}s resolution limit within a short advectve period on the order of a day.},

	volume = {323},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/38149},
	abstract = {Observations of temperature and currents have been made in the lower part of the water column on the western slope of the Porcupine Bank southwest of Ireland where the water depth is about 3500 m. Moored and lowered instruments were used to study the processes that may lead to mixing and diapycnal transfer. A poleward Eulerian mean flow of about 2.5 cm s-1 is found in the bottom 250 m, with current direction rotating anticlockwise as the bottom is approached. The shear between 30 and 90 m off the bottom is, on average, geostrophic and the temperature variation at a point averaged over several tidal cycles is dominated by along-slope advection. There is, however, considerable variability, with strong semidiurnal oscillations in both current and temperature. There is a downward phase propagation in temperature at these frequencies indicating the presence of baroclinic M2 waves. It is possible that these are responsible for the apparent along and off-slope fluxes of heat that are observed. Fluctuations with periods of 5-6 days appear to propagate polewards along slope with phase speeds of about 13 cm s-1, but have constant phase lines lying roughly north-south at an acute angle to the mean contours of the slope. Profiles of potential temperature obtained by using a lowered conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) instrument show the presence of frequent inversions in the lower 150 m, sometimes exceeding 30 m in height. A moored array of platinum resistance thermometers sampling at 10 s intervals indicates that the inversions are associated with the semidiurnal variability in temperature, the most frequent inversions occurring when the temperature 10 m off the bottom is greatest and when the temperature is falling at higher levels with a component of the current directed upslope. Indirect estimates of the vertical diffusivity and turbulent dissipation are derived from the observed scales of inversions and the overall stratification. These are subject to considerable uncertainty but suggest that the contribution to turbulence in the boundary layer from the inversions may exceed that supplied by the shear stress on the sea bed. Sources in instability are discussed, and one is examined analytically. An exact steady or time-dependent solution of flow of a stratified fluid parallel to a sloping boundary is derived. Solutions in which the density remains statically stable are possible only when a rather delicate balance exists between flow, stratification and diffusion.},

	abstract = {Mode waters are a distinctive baroclinic feature of the World Ocean characterized by relatively weak vertical stratification. They correspond dynamically to low potential vorticity (PV). In the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, the mode waters have become known as Eighteen Degree Water. Their dynamics involves air{\textendash}sea interaction, diapycnal and isopycnal mixing, and subduction. Understanding mode water dynamics is therefore both challenging and important since it connects several aspects of the ocean circulation. Mass and PV budget of the mode water's core, evaluated in a realistic primitive equation North Atlantic model, are used to characterize mode water maintenance. It is shown that the surface PV flux has very little impact on mode water; the surface buoyancy flux in combination with eddy mass flux is the most important control on mode water structure. A mean PV formalism is used to show that the PV and water-mass formation budgets are intrinsically linked. A decomposition of the budget demonstrates the role of the mean PV field in permitting the eddy mass flux to discharge the net formation to the surrounding fluid.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional eddies in a homogeneous fluid at large Reynolds number, if closely packed, are known to evolve towards larger scales. In the presence of a restoring force, the geophysical beta-effect, this cascade produces a field of waves without loss of energy, and the turbulent migration of the dominant scale nearly ceases at a wavenumber k$\beta$ = ($\beta$/2U){\textonehalf} independent of the initial conditions other than U, the r.m.s. particle speed, and $\beta$, the northward gradient of the Coriolis frequency.The conversion of turbulence into waves yields, in addition, more narrowly peaked wavenumber spectra and less fine-structure in the spatial maps, while smoothly distributing the energy about physical space.The theory is discussed, using known integral constraints and similarity solutions, model equations, weak-interaction wave theory (which provides the terminus for the cascade) and other linearized instability theory. Computer experiments with both finite-difference and spectral codes are reported. The central quantity is the cascade rate, defined as {\textbackslash}textbackslash[ T = 2{\textbackslash}textbackslashint\_0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty\} kF(k)dk/U{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}textbackslashlangle k{\textbackslash}textbackslashrangle , {\textbackslash}textbackslash] where F is the nonlinear transfer spectrum and ?k? the mean wavenumber of the energy spectrum. (In unforced inviscid flow T is simply U-1d?k?-1/dt, or the rate at which the dominant scale expands in time t.) T is shown to have a mean value of 3{\textperiodcentered}0 {\texttimes} 10-2 for pure two-dimensional turbulence, but this decreases by a factor of five at the transition to wave motion. We infer from weak-interaction theory even smaller values for k [Lt ] k$\beta$.After passing through a state of propagating waves, the homogeneous cascade tends towards a flow of alternating zonal jets which, we suggest, are almost perfectly steady. When the energy is intermittent in space, however, model equations show that the cascade is halted simply by the spreading of energy about space, and then the end state of a zonal flow is probably not achieved.The geophysical application is that the cascade of pure turbulence to large scales is defeated by wave propagation, helping to explain why the energy-containing eddies in the ocean and atmosphere, though significantly nonlinear, fail to reach the size of their respective domains, and are much smaller. For typical ocean flows, \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} = 70{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm km\} \$, while for the atmosphere, \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} = 1000{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm km\}\$. In addition the cascade generates, by itself, zonal flow (or more generally, flow along geostrophic contours).},

	abstract = {With the purpose of studying the upper part of the ocean, the shallow water equations (in a `reduced gravity' setting) have been extended in the last decades by allowing for horizontal and temporal variations of the buoyancy field $\vartheta$, while keeping it as well as the velocity field u as depth-independent. In spite of the widespread use of this `slab' model, there has been neither a discussion on the range of validity of the system nor an explanation of points such as the existence of peculiar zero-frequency normal modes, the nature of the instability of a uniform u flow, and the lack of explicit vertical shear associated with horizontal density gradients. These questions are addressed here through the development of a subinertial model with more vertical resolution, i.e., one where the buoyancy $\vartheta$ varies linearly with depth. This model describes satisfactorily the problem of baroclinic instability with a free boundary, even for short perturbations and large interface slopes. An enhancement of the instability is found when the planetary $\beta$ effect is compensated with the topographic one, due to the slope of the free boundary, allowing for a `resonance' of the equivalent barotropic and first baroclinic modes. Other low-frequency models, for which buoyancy stratification does not play a dynamical role, are invalid for short perturbations and have spurious terms in their energy-like integral of motion.},

	abstract = {Eady's model of baroclinic instability has been generalized by including $\beta$ (the meridional gradient of planetary potential vorticity) while assuming that total potential vorticity is uniform. Moreover, the problems of Eady and of Phillips have been enriched by including a fixed topography or a free boundary (which implies a flow-dependent geostrophic topography). The most general cases (with $\beta$, fixed topography and a free boundary) of both problems are shown to have nearly identical stability properties, mainly determined by two Charney numbers: the planetary one and a topographic one. The question of whether this generalized baroclinic instability problem can be described by wave resonance or component {\textquoteleft}resonance{\textquoteright} is addressed. By waves are meant physical modes, which could freely propagate by themselves but are effectively coupled by an independent basic shear, producing the instability. Components, on the other hand, are mathematical modes for which the shear is also crucial for their existence, not just for their coupling, hence the quotation marks around {\textquoteleft}resonance{\textquoteright}. In this paper it is shown that both scenarios, components {\textquoteleft}resonance{\textquoteright} and waves resonance, cast light on the free-boundary baroclinic instability problem by providing explanations of the instability onset (at minimum shear) and maximum growth rate cases, respectively. The importance of the mode pseudomomentum for the fulfillment of both mechanisms is also stressed.},

	abstract = {Instability and lateral eddy fluxes associated with a tidal mixing front are studied using idealized primitive equation numerical model runs. The front itself develops as a result of turbulence associated with imposed tidal currents over a sloping bottom. Thus, the model includes realistic levels of turbulence and time-dependence in the base-state conditions. In all of the 21 configurations considered, the front is unstable to fluctuations that usually draw energy primarily from the potential energy pool. Scalings are developed to parameterize a) the location of the tidal mixing front; b) the eddy kinetic energy; and c) the lateral eddy coefficients. In all cases, baroclinic instability enhances the lateral mixing relative to the two-dimensional case, but the extent of enhancement varies with the input parameters. Preliminary model runs that include a simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus biological model do not suggest any substantial ecological effect of the baroclinic instabilities. The lack of a strong biological effect, despite the enhanced eddy transports, occurs because of the near cancelation of oppositely directed cross-isobath eddy fluxes in the upper and lower parts of the water column. Similarly, shallow and deep cross-frontal eddy heat fluxes also nearly balance: this cancelation appears to help explain how the classical one-dimensional potential energy criterion for frontal location can work so well in a complex ocean.},

	abstract = {Eady's model for the stability of a thermal wind in an inviscid, stratified, rotating system is modified to allow for deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. The stability properties of the flow are uniquely determined by two parameters: the Richardson number Ri, and the ratio of the aspect ratio to the Rossby number $\delta$. The latter parameter may be taken as a measure of the deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium ($\delta$ = 0 in Eady's model). It is found that such deviations decrease the growth rates of all three kinds of instability which can occur in this problem: {\textquoteleft}geostrophic{\textquoteright} baroclinic instability, symmetric instability, and Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instability. The unstable wavelengths for {\textquoteleft}geostrophic{\textquoteright} and Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instability are increased for finite values of $\delta$, while the unstable wavelengths for symmetric instability are unaffected. The {\textquoteleft}non-hydrostatic{\textquoteright} effects ($\delta$ /= 0) are significant for symmetric and Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instability when $\delta$ [gsim ] 1, but not for {\textquoteleft}geostrophic{\textquoteright} instability unless $\delta$ [Gt ] 1. Consequently, the first two types of instability tend to be suppressed relative to {\textquoteleft}geostrophic{\textquoteright} instability by {\textquoteleft}non-hydrostatic{\textquoteright} conditions. Figure 3 summarizes the different instability r{\'e}gimes that can occur. In laboratory experiments symmetric instability can be studied best when $\delta$ [lsim ] 1, while Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instability can be studied best when $\delta$ [Lt ] 1.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to understand the degree to which the stability of a shelfbreak front, characterized by continuous horizontal and vertical shear, is affected by topography, a linear stability analysis was conducted for a range of frontal jets and bottom-slope configurations. Three-dimensional perturbations superposed on a continuously stratified shelfbreak front were investigated using linearized, hydrostatic primitive equations. For all model runs in the study, the frontal instability mode, which is the fastest-growing mode for a baroclinic flow, was not influenced by the bottom: Retrograde, prograde, and flat-bottom jets all share the same stability characteristics. In contrast, weakly baroclinic jets are strongly influenced by bottom topography. The presence of a bottom slope stabilizes prograde jets and destabilizes retrograde jets, a difference attributed to the orientation of the isopycnals relative to the bottom slope. Temporal and/or downstream changes in the bottom slope and/or background stratification are shown to produce sizeable changes in the instability of a weakly baroclinic jet.},

This chapter discusses some of the simple theoretical models together with an attempt to extend a few of them to take into account additional features that are not normally included in the models. First, a simple model for deriving the ellipticity of the earth is presented. It is followed by the derivation of the equations of fluid motion in elliptical coordinates and the approximation involved in the use of a spherical coordinate system to analyze oceanographic motions. The approximations encountered in theoretical studies of large-scale flows are then discussed. Next, simple geostrophic flows and their significance are presented. The chapter presents the study of Ekman layers and the role that they play in large-scale circulation and also discusses turbulent transport. The chapter concludes with discussion on laboratory modeling of ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {The overturning circulation of the global ocean is critically shaped by deep-ocean mixing, which transforms cold waters sinking at high latitudes into warmer, shallower waters. The effectiveness of mixing in driving this transformation is jointly set by two factors: the intensity of turbulence near topography and the rate at which well-mixed boundary waters are exchanged with the stratified ocean interior. Here, we use innovative observations of a major branch of the overturning circulation{\textemdash}an abyssal boundary current in the Southern Ocean{\textemdash}to identify a previously undocumented mixing mechanism, by which deep-ocean waters are efficiently laundered through intensified near-boundary turbulence and boundary{\textendash}interior exchange. The linchpin of the mechanism is the generation of submesoscale dynamical instabilities by the flow of deep-ocean waters along a steep topographic boundary. As the conditions conducive to this mode of mixing are common to many abyssal boundary currents, our findings highlight an imperative for its representation in models of oceanic overturning.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new estimate is made using altimeter data of the rate at which the wind works on the oceanic general circulation. The value of about 1 TW is lower than previously estimated and is dominated by the work done by the mean zonal wind in the Southern Ocean. The meridional component of the mean wind contributes primarily in the eastern upwelling regions of the ocean. Fluctuating component contributions are small. A comparison with the results of a numerical model produces both the same total work as well as the same general geographical patterns but with detailed differences. Both observations and model show that the subtropical gyres are regions where the atmosphere is braking the ocean circulation. The input of wind energy is shown to be qualitatively consistent with estimates of the rates of decay of barotropic and baroclinic mesoscale variability. If most of the energy input into the Southern Ocean is dissipated there, this region could be a dominant factor in mixing the global ocean.},

	abstract = {In this study, we revisit the problem of rotating dense overflow dynamics by performing nonhydrostatic numerical simulations, resolving submesoscale variability. Thermohaline stratification and buoyancy forcing are based on data from the Eurasian basin of the Arctic Ocean, where overflows are particularly crucial to the exchange of dense water between shelves and deep basins, yet have been studied relatively little. A nonlinear equation of state is used, allowing proper representation of thermohaline structure and mixing. We examine three increasingly complex scenarios: nonrotating 2D, rotating 2D, and rotating 3D. The nonrotating 2D case behaves according to known theory: the gravity current descends alongslope until reaching a relatively shallow neutral buoyancy level. However, in the rotating cases, we have identified novel dynamics: in both 2D and 3D, the submesoscale range is dominated by symmetric instability (SI). Rotation leads to geostrophic adjustment, causing dense water to be confined within the forcing region longer and attain a greater density anomaly. In the 2D case, Ekman drainage leads to descent of the geostrophic jet, forming a highly dense alongslope front. Beams of negative Ertel potential vorticity develop parallel to the slope, initiating SI and vigorous mixing in the overflow. In 3D, baroclinic eddies are responsible for cross-isobath dense water transport, but SI again develops along the slope and at eddy edges. Remarkably, through two different dynamics, the 2D SI-dominated case and 3D eddy-dominated case attain roughly the same final water mass distribution, highlighting the potential role of SI in driving mixing within certain regimes of dense overflows.},

	abstract = {Numerical solutions of partial differential equations enable a broad range of scientific research. The Dedalus Project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation. The Dedalus code and the example problems are available online at http://dedalus-project.org/.},

	abstract = {Submesoscale oceanic density fronts are structures in geostrophic and hydrostatic balance, which are prone to inertial and/or symmetric instabilities. We argue in this article that drainage of potential energy from the geostrophic flow is a significant source of their growth. We illustrate our point with two-dimensional Boussinesq numerical simulations of oceanic density fronts on the f plane. A set of two-dimensional initial conditions covers the submesoscale portion of a three-dimensional parameter space consisting of the Richardson and Rossby numbers and a measure of stratification or latitude. Because we let the lateral density gradient decay with depth, the parameter space map is nontrivial, excluding low-Rossby, low-Richardson combinations. Dissipation and the presence of boundaries select a growing mode of inertial{\textendash}symmetric instability consisting of flow cells that disturb isopycnal contours. Systematically, these isopycnal displacements correspond to a drainage of potential energy from the geostrophic fronts to the ageostrophic perturbations. In the majority of our experiments, this energy drainage is at least as important as the drainage of kinetic energy from the front. Various constraints, some physical, some numerical, make the energetics in our experiments more related to inertial rather than symmetric instabilities. Our results depend very weakly on the Richardson number and more on the Rossby number and relative stratification.},

We find that such surfaces are extremizers of a universal, nondimensional transport functional whose leading-order term in the diffusivity can be computed directly from the flow velocity. The most observable (uniform) transport extremizers are explicitly computable as null surfaces of an objective transport tensor. Even in the limit of vanishing diffusivity, these surfaces differ from all previously identified coherent structures for purely advective fluid transport. Our results extend directly to stochastic velocity fields and hence enable transport barrier and enhancer detection under uncertainties.},

Moored observations at 140{\textdegree}W have shown seasonal variability in the stratification, velocity shear, and turbulence above the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). In boreal spring, the thermocline and EUC shoal and turbulence decreases. Marginal instability (clustering of the local gradient Richardson number around the critical value of 1/4), evident throughout the rest of the year, has not been detected during spring. While the daily averaged turbulent energy dissipation in the EUC is weakest during the spring, it is not clear whether the diurnal fluctuations that define the deep cycle cease. Large-eddy simulations are performed using climatological initial and boundary conditions representative of January, April, July, and October. Deep cycle turbulence is evident in all cases; the mechanism remains the same, and the maximum turbulence levels are similar. In the April simulation, however, the deep cycle is confined to the uppermost {\textasciitilde}30 m, explaining why it has not been detected in moored microstructure observations.},

A companion paper outlined the evolution of the front, revealing the importance of lateral advection at tilting isopycnals and increasing stratification in the surface boundary layer with a buoyancy flux equivalent to 2000 W m
              -2
              . Here, observations were compared with idealized models to explore the dynamics contributing to the stratification. A 2D model combined with a reduced form of the horizontal momentum equations highlight the importance of transient Ekman dynamics, turbulence, and thermal wind imbalance at modulating shear in the boundary layer. Specifically, unsteady frictional adjustment to the rapid decrease in wind stress created vertically sheared currents that advected horizontal gradients to increase vertical stratification on superinertial time scales. The magnitude of stratification depended on the strength of the horizontal buoyancy gradient. This enhanced stratification due to horizontal advection inhibited nighttime mixing that would have otherwise eroded stratification from the diurnal warm layer. This underscores the importance of near-surface lateral restratification for the upper ocean buoyancy budget on diel time scales.},

This product utilizes the CoastWatch product format and the basic archive file is a NetCDF-4 file containing SAR wind, land mask, and time and earth location information. Also archived are maps of the SAR winds in GeoTIFF format. The product covers the geographic extent of the SAR image frame from which it was derived. These SAR-derived high resolution wind products are calculated from high resolution SAR images of normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of the Earth's surface. Backscattered microwave radar returns from the ocean surface are strongly dependent on wind speed and direction. When no wind is present, the surface of the water is smooth, almost glass-like. Radar energy will largely be reflected away and the radar cross section will be low. As the wind begins to blow, the surface roughens and surface waves begin to develop. As the wind continues to blow more strongly, the amplitude of the wave increases, thus, roughening the surface more. As the surface roughness increases, more energy is backscattered and NRCS increases. Moreover, careful examination of the wind-generated waves reveals that these surface wave crests are generally aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, suggesting a dependence of backscatter on the relative direction between the incident radar energy and the wind direction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The differences between Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) anemometer and QuikSCAT scatterometer winds are analyzed over a period of 3 yr. Systematic differences are expected owing to ocean currents because the anemometer measures absolute air motion, whereas a radar measures the motion of the air relative to the ocean. Monthly averaged collocated wind differences (CWDs) are compared with available near-surface current data at 15-m depth from drifters, at 25-m depth from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and at 10-m depth from current meters and with geostrophic currents at the surface from the TOPEX/Poseidon radar altimeter. Because direct current observations are so sparse, comparisons are also made with climatological currents from these same sources. Zonal CWDs are in good agreement with the zonal current observations, particularly from 2{\textdegree}S to 2{\textdegree}N where there are strong currents and a robust seasonal cycle, with the altimeter-derived anomalous currents giving the best match. At higher latitudes there is qualitative agreement at buoys with relatively large currents. The overall variance of the zonal component of the CWDs is reduced by approximately 25\% by subtracting an estimate of the zonal currents. The meridional CWDs are nearly as large as the zonal CWDs but are unpredictable. The mean CWDs show a robust divergence pattern about the equator, which is suggestive of Ekman currents, but with unexpectedly large magnitudes.
            Coefficients for estimating climatological zonal surface currents from the altimeter at the TAO buoys are tabulated: the amplitudes and phases for the annual and semiannual harmonics, and a linear regression against the Southern Oscillation index, are combined with the mean from the drifter currents. Examples are shown of the application of these estimators to data from SeaWinds on the Midori satellite. These estimators are also useful for deriving air{\textendash}sea fluxes from TAO winds.},

	abstract = {Regional characteristics of the climatological seasonal variations in Southern Hemisphere (SH) storm tracks are examined based on a reanalysis dataset. When differences in vertical structure between the subpolar and subtropical jet streams (SPJ and STJ, respectively) are considered, the regional characteristics can be interpreted reasonably well from a potential vorticity perspective of baroclinic eddy growth and downstream development of a baroclinic wave packet.Eddy activity in the upper and lower tropospheres is strongest in the core region of the SPJ over the eastern South Atlantic and Indian Ocean throughout the year, even in austral winter when the intense STJ forms over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific. Showing its eddy-driven nature, the SPJ accompanies the strong surface westerlies along a well-defined baroclinic zone above an intense oceanic frontal zone. In this core region of the storm track, low-level eddy activity is strongly correlated with the local near-surface baroclinicity, with its late- winter maximum and summer minimum, while upper-level eddy activity also depends on the incoming wave activity from upstream.Over the South Pacific, storm track activity depends critically on the formation of the STJ. In the absence of the intense STJ in summer and autumn, a single well-defined circumpolar storm track forms along the SPJ. During winter and spring, in contrast, wave activity accumulated in the core region is dispersed mainly toward the STJ, along which vigorous baroclinic eddy growth is unlikely to occur. The South Pacific storm track in the upper troposphere thus bifurcates into two branches along the STJ and SPJ, while at lower levels the storm track forms only along the enhanced baroclinic zone along the SPJ. Thus, under the trapping effect of the intense STJ, the storm track activity over the South Pacific is suppressed in winter, despite the enhanced low-level baroclinicity.},

	abstract = {Ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction over the Northern Hemisphere western boundary current (WBC) regions (i.e., the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, Oyashio, and their extensions) is reviewed with an emphasis on their role in basin-scale climate variability. SST anomalies exhibit considerable variance on interannual to decadal time scales in these regions. Low-frequency SST variability is primarily driven by basin-scale wind stress curl variability via the oceanic Rossby wave adjustment of the gyre-scale circulation that modulates the latitude and strength of the WBC-related oceanic fronts. Rectification of the variability by mesoscale eddies, reemergence of the anomalies from the preceding winter, and tropical remote forcing also play important roles in driving and maintaining the low-frequency variability in these regions. In the Gulf Stream region, interaction with the deep western boundary current also likely influences the low-frequency variability. Surface heat fluxes damp the low-frequency SST anomalies over the WBC regions; thus, heat fluxes originate with heat anomalies in the ocean and have the potential to drive the overlying atmospheric circulation. While recent observational studies demonstrate a local atmospheric boundary layer response to WBC changes, the latter{\textquoteright}s influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation is still unclear. Nevertheless, heat and moisture fluxes from the WBCs into the atmosphere influence the mean state of the atmospheric circulation, including anchoring the latitude of the storm tracks to the WBCs. Furthermore, many climate models suggest that the large-scale atmospheric response to SST anomalies driven by ocean dynamics in WBC regions can be important in generating decadal climate variability. As a step toward bridging climate model results and observations, the degree of realism of the WBC in current climate model simulations is assessed. Finally, outstanding issues concerning ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction in WBC regions and its impact on climate variability are discussed.},

Perturbing the stress calculation with sea surface velocity results in a {\textquotedblleft}top drag{\textquotedblright}, which causes interior motions to decay. Numerical experiments with equivalent barotropic quasi-geostrophic dynamics and reasonable estimates for the top drag suggest that this mechanism can amount for a significant fraction of observed isotherm subsidence rates in rings. Perturbing the stress calculation with a temperature sensitive drag coefficient produces a dipolar Ekman pumping field over a ring. For an eastward directed wind, the result is a tendency for the ring to self-propagate to the south. Integral constraints can be used to estimate the meridional propagation rate precisely, and for reasonable stress and thermal anomaly values, the estimate compares well with observations.},

	abstract = {The Gulf Stream (GS) is known to have a strong influence on climate, for example, by transporting heat from the tropics to higher latitudes. Although the GS transport intensity presents a clear interannual variability, satellite observations reveal its mean path is stable. Numerical models can simulate some characteristics of the mean GS path, but persistent biases keep the GS separation and postseparation unstable and therefore unrealistic. This study investigates how the integration of ocean surface currents into the ocean{\textendash}atmosphere coupling interface of numerical models impacts the GS. The authors show for the first time that the current feedback, through its eddy killing effect, stabilizes the GS separation and postseparation, resolving long-lasting biases in modeled GS path, at least for the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). This key process should therefore be taken into account in oceanic numerical models. Using a set of oceanic and atmospheric coupled and uncoupled simulations, this study shows that the current feedback, by modulating the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, has two main effects on the ocean. On one hand, by reducing the mean surface stress and thus weakening the mean geostrophic wind work by 30\%, the current feedback slows down the whole North Atlantic oceanic gyre, making the GS narrower and its transport weaker. Yet, on the other hand, the current feedback acts as an oceanic eddy killer, reducing the surface eddy kinetic energy by 27\%. By inducing a surface stress curl opposite to the current vorticity, it deflects energy from the geostrophic current into the atmosphere and dampens eddies.},

	abstract = {The effects of surface wind speed and direction gradients on midlatitude surface vorticity and divergence fields associated with mesoscale sea surface temperature (SST) variability having spatial scales of 100{\textendash}1000 km are investigated using vector wind observations from the SeaWinds scatterometer on the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite and SST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Aqua satellite. The wind{\textendash}SST coupling is analyzed over the period June 2002{\textendash}August 2008, corresponding to the first 6+ years of the AMSR-E mission. Previous studies have shown that strong wind speed gradients develop in response to persistent mesoscale SST features associated with the Kuroshio Extension, Gulf Stream, South Atlantic, and Agulhas Return Current regions. Midlatitude SST fronts also significantly modify surface wind direction; the surface wind speed and direction responses to typical SST differences of about 2{\textdegree}{\textendash}4{\textdegree}C are, on average, about 1{\textendash}2 m s
              -1
              and 4{\textdegree}{\textendash}8{\textdegree}, respectively, over all four regions. Wind speed perturbations are positively correlated and very nearly collocated spatially with the SST perturbations. Wind direction perturbations, however, are displaced meridionally from the SST perturbations, with cyclonic flow poleward of warm SST and anticyclonic flow poleward of cool SST.
            
            Previous observational analyses have shown that small-scale perturbations in the surface vorticity and divergence fields are related linearly to the crosswind and downwind components of the SST gradient, respectively. When the vorticity and divergence fields are analyzed in curvilinear natural coordinates, the wind speed contributions to the SST-induced vorticity and divergence depend equally on the crosswind and downwind SST gradients, respectively. SST-induced wind direction gradients also significantly modify the vorticity and divergence fields, weakening the vorticity response to crosswind SST gradients while enhancing the divergence response to downwind SST gradients.},

In the Gulf Stream region, steep kinetic energy spectra at scales between 200 and 20 km are consistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic{\textendash}turbulence theory, both in the mixed layer and in the thermocline. At scales below 20 km, the spectra flatten out, consistent with a growing contribution of internal-wave energy at small scales. In the subtropical North Pacific, the energy spectra are flatter and inconsistent with predictions of interior quasigeostrophic{\textendash}turbulence theory. The observed spectra and their dependence on depth are also inconsistent with predictions of surface quasigeostrophic{\textendash}turbulence theory for the observed ocean stratification. It appears that unbalanced motions, most likely internal tides at large scales and the internal-wave continuum at small scales, dominate the energy spectrum throughout the submesoscale range. Spectra of temperature variance along density surfaces, which are not affected by internal tides, are also inconsistent with predictions of geostrophic-turbulence theories. Reasons for this inconsistency could be the injection of energy in the submesoscale range by small-scale baroclinic instabilities or modifications of the spectra by coupling between surface and interior dynamics or by ageostrophic frontal effects.},

The latter plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of cumulonimbus convection and rainfall.Our approach is to consider a simple one-layer model of the trade cumulus boundary layer wherein surface temperature gradients are mixed vertically{\textemdash}consistent with ECMWF analyzed data. The top of the layer is taken at 700 mb. The influence from higher levels is intentionally suppressed by setting horizontal pressure gradients and frictional stresses to zero at the top of the layer. Horizontal convergence within the layer is taken up by cumulonimbus mass flux. However, the development of the cumulonimbus mass flux is associated with a short relaxation time [O({\textonehalf} hr)] (roughly the development time for such convection). During this short time, horizontal convergence acts to redistribute mass so as to reduce horizontal pressure gradients. This effect proves important in the immediate neighborhood of the equator.Our results show that flows forced directly by surface temperature are often comparable to observed low-level flows in both magnitude and distribution.},

            Flow along isobaths of a sloping lower boundary generates an across-isobath Ekman transport in the bottom boundary layer. When this Ekman transport is down the slope it causes convective mixing{\textemdash}much like a downfront wind in the surface boundary layer{\textemdash}destroying stratification and potential vorticity. In this manuscript we show how this can lead to the development of a forced centrifugal or symmetric instability regime, where the potential vorticity flux generated by friction along the boundary is balanced by submesoscale instabilities that return the boundary layer potential vorticity to zero. This balance provides a strong constraint on the boundary layer evolution, which we use to develop a theory that explains the evolution of the boundary layer thickness, the rate at which the instabilities extract energy from the geostrophic flow field, and the magnitude and vertical structure of the dissipation. Finally, we show using theory and a high-resolution numerical model how the presence of centrifugal or symmetric instabilities alters the time-dependent Ekman adjustment of the boundary layer, delaying Ekman buoyancy arrest and enhancing the total energy removed from the balanced flow field. Submesoscale instabilities of the bottom boundary layer may therefore play an important, largely overlooked, role in the energetics of flow over topography in the ocean.},

Exchange across the front is believed to be important for both ocean circulation and biological productivity; however, the physical mechanisms responsible are not fully understood. Here, we present direct observational evidence of enhanced mixing across the north wall of the Gulf Stream. High-resolution simulations suggest that the presence of the sharp density front, not typically resolved in ocean-circulation models, is central to generating the observed mixing. Interpreting the observations in terms of the flux of freshwater and nutrients across the Gulf Stream north wall suggests an important mechanism of exchange that has not been fully explored.The Gulf Stream front separates the North Atlantic subtropical and subpolar ocean gyres, water masses with distinct physical and biogeochemical properties. Exchange across the front is believed to be necessary to balance the freshwater budget of the subtropical gyre and to support the biological productivity of the region; however, the physical mechanisms responsible have been the subject of long-standing debate. Here, the evolution of a passive dye released within the north wall of the Gulf Stream provides direct observational evidence of enhanced mixing across the Gulf Stream front. Numerical simulations indicate that the observed rapid cross-frontal mixing occurs via shear dispersion, generated by frontal instabilities and episodic vertical mixing. This provides unique direct evidence for the role of submesoscale fronts in generating lateral mixing, a mechanism which has been hypothesized to be of general importance for setting the horizontal structure of the ocean mixed layer. Along the Gulf Stream front in the North Atlantic, these observations further suggest that shear dispersion at sharp fronts may provide a source of freshwater flux large enough to explain much of the freshwater deficit in the subtropical-mode water budget and a flux of nutrients comparable to other mechanisms believed to control primary productivity in the subtropical gyre.},

            The influence of submesoscale currents on the distribution and subduction of passive, buoyant tracers in the mixed layer is examined using large-eddy simulations. Submesoscale eddies are generated through an ageostrophic baroclinic instability associated with a background horizontal buoyancy gradient. The simulations also include various levels of surface cooling, which provides an additional source of three-dimensional turbulence. Submesoscales compete against turbulent convection and restratify the mixed layer while generating strong turbulence along a submesoscale front. Buoyant tracers accumulate at the surface along the submesoscale front where they are subducted down into the water column. The presence of submesoscales strongly modifies the vertical tracer flux, even in the presence of strong convective forcing. The correlation between high tracer concentration and strong downwelling enhances the vertical diffusivity for buoyant tracers.},

            This paper revisits how the restratifying buoyancy flux generated by baroclinic mixed layer instabilities depends on environmental conditions. The frontal spindown is shown to produce buoyancy fluxes that increase significantly beyond the previously proposed and widely used scaling (f is the Coriolis parameter, $\Lambda$ is the geostrophic shear, and H is the mixed layer depth), irrespective of whether the initial front is broad or narrow. This increase occurs after the initial phase of the nonlinear evolution, when the baroclinic eddies grow in size and develop velocities significantly in excess of the scaling assumption V {\textasciitilde} $\Lambda$H. Implications for parameterizing the restratification caused by baroclinic mixed layer instabilities in coarse-resolution models are discussed.},

            Here, the effects of surface waves on submesoscale instabilities are studied through analytical and linear analyses as well as nonlinear large-eddy simulations of the wave-averaged Boussinesq equations. The wave averaging yields a surface-intensified current (Stokes drift) that advects momentum, adds to the total Coriolis force, and induces a Stokes shear force. The Stokes{\textendash}Coriolis force alters the geostrophically balanced flow by reducing the burden on the Eulerian{\textendash}Coriolis force to prop up the front, thereby potentially inciting an anti-Stokes Eulerian shear, while maintaining the Lagrangian (Eulerian plus Stokes) shear. Since the Lagrangian shear is maintained, the Charney{\textendash}Stern{\textendash}Pedlosky criteria for quasigeostrophic (QG) baroclinic instability are unchanged with the appropriate Lagrangian interpretation of the shear and QG potential vorticity. While the Stokes drift does not directly affect vorticity, the anti-Stokes Eulerian shear contributes to the Ertel potential vorticity (PV). When the Stokes shear and geostrophic shear are aligned (antialigned), the PV is more (less) cyclonic. If the Stokes-modified PV is anticyclonic, the flow is unstable to symmetric instabilities (SI). Stokes drift also weakly impacts SI through the Stokes shear force. When the Stokes and Eulerian shears are the same (opposite) sign, the Stokes shear force does positive (negative) work on the flow associated with SI. Stokes drift also allows SI to extract more potential energy from the front, providing an indirect mechanism for Stokes-induced restratification.},

Prediction of their resulting distribution on the surface is a fundamental, long-standing, and practically important problem. The dominant paradigm is dispersion within the dynamical context of a nondivergent flow: objects initially close together will on average spread apart but the area of surface patches of material does not change. Although this paradigm is likely valid at mesoscales, larger than 100 km in horizontal scale, recent theoretical studies of submesoscales (less than \~{}10 km) predict strong surface convergences and downwelling associated with horizontal density fronts and cyclonic vortices.

Together, these effects set both the overall extent and the finescale texture of a patch of floating material. Material concentrated at submesoscale convergences can create unique communities of organisms, amplify impacts of toxic material, and create opportunities to more efficiently recover such material.},

            We use idealized large-eddy simulations (LES) and a simple analytical theory to study the influence of submesoscales on the concentration and export of sinking particles from the mixed layer. We find that restratification of the mixed layer following the development of submesoscales reduces the rate of vertical mixing which, in turn, enhances the export rate associated with gravitational settling. For a neutral tracer initially confined to the mixed layer, subinertial (submesoscale) motions enhance the downward tracer flux, consistent with previous studies. However, the sign of the advective flux associated with the concentration of sinking particles reverses, indicating reentrainment into the mixed layer. A new theory is developed to model the gravitational settling flux when the particle concentration is nonuniform. The theory broadly agrees with the LES results and allows us to extend the analysis to a wider range of parameters.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Laboratory and field studies have revealed that iron has multiple roles in phytoplankton physiology, with particular importance for light-harvesting cellular machinery. However, although iron-limitation is explicitly included in numerous biogeochemical/ecosystem models, its implementation varies, and its effect on the efficiency of light harvesting is often ignored. Given the complexity of the ocean environment, it is difficult to predict the consequences of applying different iron limitation schemes. Here we explore the interaction of iron and nutrient cycles in an ocean general circulation model using a new, streamlined model of ocean biogeochemistry. Building on previously published parameterizations of photoadaptation and export production, the Biogeochemistry with Light Iron Nutrients and Gasses (BLING) model is constructed with only four explicit tracers but including macronutrient and micronutrient limitation, light limitation, and an implicit treatment of community structure. The structural simplicity of this computationally-inexpensive model allows us to clearly isolate the global effect that iron availability has on maximum light-saturated photosynthesis rates vs. the effect iron has on photosynthetic efficiency. We find that the effect on light-saturated photosynthesis rates is dominant, negating the importance of photosynthetic efficiency in most regions, especially the cold waters of the Southern Ocean. The primary exceptions to this occur in iron-rich regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where high light-saturated photosynthesis rates allow photosynthetic efficiency to play a more important role. In other words, the ability to efficiently harvest photons has little effect in regions where light-saturated growth rates are low. Additionally, we speculate that the phytoplankton cells dominating iron-limited regions tend to have relatively high photosynthetic efficiency, due to reduced packaging effects. If this speculation is correct, it would imply that natural communities of iron-stressed phytoplankton may tend to harvest photons more efficiently than would be inferred from iron-limitation experiments with other phytoplankton. We suggest that iron limitation of photosynthetic efficiency has a relatively small impact on global biogeochemistry, though it is expected to impact the seasonal cycle of plankton as well as the vertical structure of primary production.},

	abstract = {Floating oil, plastics, and marine organisms are continually redistributed by ocean surface currents. Prediction of their resulting distribution on the surface is a fundamental, long-standing, and practically important problem. The dominant paradigm is dispersion within the dynamical context of a nondivergent flow: objects initially close together will on average spread apart but the area of surface patches of material does not change. Although this paradigm is likely valid at mesoscales, larger than 100 km in horizontal scale, recent theoretical studies of submesoscales (less than \~{}10 km) predict strong surface convergences and downwelling associated with horizontal density fronts and cyclonic vortices. Here we show that such structures can dramatically concentrate floating material. More than half of an array of \~{}200 surface drifters covering \~{}20 {\texttimes} 20 km
              2

              and 0.01 ms
              -1
              , respectively, which is much larger than usually inferred. This suggests a paradigm in which nearby objects form submesoscale clusters, and these clusters then spread apart. Together, these effects set both the overall extent and the finescale texture of a patch of floating material. Material concentrated at submesoscale convergences can create unique communities of organisms, amplify impacts of toxic material, and create opportunities to more efficiently recover such material.},

            Baroclinic mixed-layer instabilities have recently been recognized as an important source of submesoscale energy in deep winter mixed layers. While the focus has so far been on the balanced dynamics of these instabilities, they occur in and depend on an environment shaped by atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence. In this study, idealized numerical simulations are presented that allow the development of both baroclinic instability and convective small-scale turbulence, with simple control over the relative strength. If the convection is only weakly forced, baroclinic instability restratifies the layer and shuts off convection, as expected. With increased forcing, however, it is found that baroclinic instabilities are remarkably resilient to the presence of convection. Even if the instability is too weak to restratify the layer and shut off convection, the instability still grows in the convecting environment and generates baroclinic eddies and fronts. This suggests that despite the vigorous atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence in winter mixed layers, baroclinic instabilities can persistently grow, generate balanced submesoscale turbulence, and modify the bulk properties of the upper ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The interactions between boundary layer turbulence, including Langmuir turbulence, and submesoscale processes in the oceanic mixed layer are described using large-eddy simulations of the spindown of a temperature front in the presence of submesoscale eddies, winds, and waves. The simulations solve the surface-wave-averaged Boussinesq equations with Stokes drift wave forcing at a resolution that is sufficiently fine to capture small-scale Langmuir turbulence. A simulation without Stokes drift forcing is also performed for comparison. Spatial and spectral properties of temperature, velocity, and vorticity fields are described, and these fields are scale decomposed in order to examine multiscale fluxes of momentum and buoyancy. Buoyancy flux results indicate that Langmuir turbulence counters the restratifying effects of submesoscale eddies, leading to small-scale vertical transport and mixing that is 4 times greater than in the simulations without Stokes drift forcing. The observed fluxes are also shown to be in good agreement with results from an asymptotic analysis of the surface-wave-averaged, or Craik{\textendash}Leibovich, equations. Regions of potential instability in the flow are identified using Richardson and Rossby numbers, and it is found that mixed gravitational/symmetric instabilities are nearly twice as prevalent when Langmuir turbulence is present, in contrast to simulations without Stokes drift forcing, which are dominated by symmetric instabilities. Mixed layer depth calculations based on potential vorticity and temperature show that the mixed layer is up to 2 times deeper in the presence of Langmuir turbulence. Differences between measures of the mixed layer depth based on potential vorticity and temperature are smaller in the simulations with Stokes drift forcing, indicating a reduced incidence of symmetric instabilities in the presence of Langmuir turbulence.},

            Within the pycnocline, where diapycnal mixing is suppressed, both the vertical movement (uplift) of isopycnal surfaces and upward motion along sloping isopycnals supply nutrients to the euphotic layer, but the relative importance of each of these mechanisms is unknown. We present a method for decomposing vertical velocity w into two components in a Lagrangian frame: vertical velocity along sloping isopycnal surfaces and the adiabatic vertical velocity of isopycnal surfaces . We show that , where is the isopycnal slope and is the geometric aspect ratio of the flow, and that accounts for 10\%{\textendash}25\% of the total vertical velocity w for isopycnal slopes representative of the midlatitude pycnocline. We perform the decomposition of w in a process study model of a midlatitude eddying flow field generated with a range of isopycnal slopes. A spectral decomposition of the velocity components shows that while is the largest contributor to vertical velocity, is of comparable magnitude at horizontal scales less than about 10 km, that is, at submesoscales. Increasing the horizontal grid resolution of models is known to increase vertical velocity; this increase is disproportionately due to better resolution of , as is shown here by comparing 1- and 4-km resolution model runs. Along-isopycnal vertical transport can be an important contributor to the vertical flux of tracers, including oxygen, nutrients, and chlorophyll, although we find weak covariance between vertical velocity and nutrient anomaly in our model.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The importance of chaotic advection relative to turbulent diffusion is
investigated in an idealized model of a 3-D swirling and overturning ocean
eddy. Various measures of stirring and mixing are examined in order to
determine when and where chaotic advection is relevant. Turbulent diffusion
is alternatively represented by (1)~an explicit, observation-based,
scale-dependent diffusivity, (2)~stochastic noise, added to a deterministic
velocity field, or (3)~explicit and implicit diffusion in a spectral numerical
model of the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations. Lagrangian chaos in our model occurs only
within distinct regions of the eddy, including a large chaotic {\textquotedblleft}sea{\textquotedblright} that
fills much of the volume near the perimeter and central axis of the eddy and
much smaller {\textquotedblleft}resonant{\textquotedblright} bands. The size and distribution of these regions
depend on factors such as the degree of axial asymmetry of the eddy and the
Ekman number. The relative importance of chaotic advection and turbulent
diffusion within the chaotic regions is quantified using three measures: the
Lagrangian Batchelor scale, the rate of dispersal of closely spaced fluid
parcels, and the Nakamura effective diffusivity. The role of chaotic
advection in the stirring of a passive tracer is generally found to be most
important within the larger chaotic seas, at intermediate times, with
small diffusivities, and for eddies with strong asymmetry. In contrast, in
thin chaotic regions, turbulent diffusion at oceanographically relevant rates
is at least as important as chaotic advection. Future work should address
anisotropic and spatially varying representations of turbulent diffusion for
more realistic models.},

	abstract = {The wind-driven stably stratified mid-latitude oceanic surface turbulent boundary layer is computationally simulated in the presence of a specified surface gravity-wave field. The gravity waves have broad wavenumber and frequency spectra typical of measured conditions in near-equilibrium with the mean wind speed. The simulation model is based on (i) an asymptotic theory for the conservative dynamical effects of waves on the wave-averaged boundary-layer currents and (ii) a boundary-layer forcing by a stochastic representation of the impulses and energy fluxes in a field of breaking waves. The wave influences are shown to be profound on both the mean current profile and turbulent statistics compared to a simulation without these wave influences and forced by an equivalent mean surface stress. As expected from previous studies with partial combinations of these wave influences, Langmuir circulations due to the wave-averaged vortex force make vertical eddy fluxes of momentum and material concentration much more efficient and non-local (i.e. with negative eddy viscosity near the surface), and they combine with the breakers to increase the turbulent energy and dissipation rate. They also combine in an unexpected positive feedback in which breaker-generated vorticity seeds the creation of a new Langmuir circulation and instigates a deep strong intermittent downwelling jet that penetrates through the boundary layer and increases the material entrainment rate at the base of the layer. These wave effects on the boundary layer are greater for smaller wave ages and higher mean wind speeds.},

            Large-eddy simulations (LESs) with various constant wind, wave, and surface destabilizing surface buoyancy flux forcing are conducted, with a focus on assessing the impact of Langmuir turbulence on the entrainment buoyancy flux at the base of the ocean surface boundary layer. An estimate of the entrainment buoyancy flux scaling is made to best fit the LES results. The presence of Stokes drift forcing and the resulting Langmuir turbulence enhances the entrainment rate significantly under weak surface destabilizing buoyancy flux conditions, that is, weakly convective turbulence. In contrast, Langmuir turbulence effects are moderate when convective turbulence is dominant and appear to be additive rather than multiplicative to the convection-induced mixing. The parameterized unresolved velocity scale in the K-profile parameterization (KPP) is modified to adhere to the new scaling law of the entrainment buoyancy flux and account for the effects of Langmuir turbulence. This modification is targeted on common situations in a climate model where either Langmuir turbulence or convection is important and may overestimate the entrainment when both are weak. Nevertheless, the modified KPP is tested in a global climate model and generally outperforms those tested in previous studies. Improvements in the simulated mixed layer depth are found, especially in the Southern Ocean in austral summer.},

            An eddy-permitting general circulation model of the Southern Ocean is fit by constrained least squares to a large observational dataset during 2005{\textendash}06. Data used include Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) instrument-mounted seal profiles, XBTs, altimetric observations [Envisat, Geosat, Jason-1, and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon], and infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature. An adjoint model is used to determine descent directions in minimizing a misfit function, each of whose elements has been weighted by an estimate of the observational plus model error. The model is brought into near agreement with the data by adjusting its control vector, here consisting of initial and meteorological boundary conditions. Although total consistency has not yet been achieved, the existing solution is in good agreement with the great majority of the 2005 and 2006 Southern Ocean observations and better represents these data than does the World Ocean Atlas 2001 (WOA01) climatological product. The estimate captures the oceanic temporal variability and in this respect represents a major improvement upon earlier static inverse estimates. During the estimation period, the Drake Passage volume transport is 153 {\textpm} 5 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s-1). The Ross and Weddell polar gyre transports are 20 {\textpm} 5 Sv and 40 {\textpm} 8 Sv, respectively. Across 32{\textdegree}S there is a surface meridional overturning cell of 12 {\textpm} 12 Sv, an intermediate cell of 17 {\textpm} 12 Sv, and an abyssal cell of 13 {\textpm} 6 Sv. The northward heat and freshwater anomaly transports across 30{\textdegree}S are -0.3 PW and 0.7 Sv, with estimated uncertainties of 0.5 PW and 0.2 Sv. The net rate of wind work is 2.1 {\textpm} 1.1 TW. Southern Ocean theories involving short temporal- and spatial-scale dynamics may now be tested with a dynamically and thermodynamically realistic general circulation model solution that is known to be compatible with the modern observational datasets.},

In a horizontally heterogeneous boundary layer, surface waves induce both mean and fluctuating Stokes-drift vortex forces that modify a linear, hydrostatic turbulent thermal wind (TTW) approximation for momentum.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Langmuir circulation (LC) is a turbulent upper-ocean process driven by wind and surface waves that contributes significantly to the transport of momentum, heat, and mass in the oceanic surface layer. The authors have previously performed a direct comparison of large-eddy simulations and observations of the upper-ocean response to a wind event with rapid mixed layer deepening. The evolution of simulated crosswind velocity variance and spatial scales, as well as mixed layer deepening, was only consistent with observations if LC effects are included in the model. Based on an analysis of these validated simulations, in this study the fundamental differences in mixing between purely shear-driven turbulence and turbulence with LC are identified. In the former case, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production due to shear instabilities is largest near the surface, gradually decreasing to zero near the base of the mixed layer. This stands in contrast to the LC case in which at middepth range TKE production can be dominated by Stokes drift shear. Furthermore, the Eulerian mean vertical shear peaks near the base of the mixed layer so that TKE production by mean shear flow is elevated there. LC transports horizontal momentum efficiently downward leading to an along-wind velocity jet below LC downwelling regions at the base of the mixed layer. Locally enhanced vertical shear instabilities as a result of this jet efficiently erode the thermocline. In turn, enhanced breaking internal waves inject cold deep water into the mixed layer, where LC currents transport temperature perturbation advectively. Thus, LC and locally generated shear instabilities work intimately together to facilitate strongly the mixed layer deepening process.},

            The central change in understanding of the ocean circulation during the past 100 years has been its emergence as an intensely time-dependent, effectively turbulent and wave-dominated, flow. Early technologies for making the difficult observations were adequate only to depict large-scale, quasi-steady flows. With the electronic revolution of the past 50+ years, the emergence of geophysical fluid dynamics, the strongly inhomogeneous time-dependent nature of oceanic circulation physics finally emerged. Mesoscale (balanced), submesoscale oceanic eddies at 100-km horizontal scales and shorter, and internal waves are now known to be central to much of the behavior of the system. Ocean circulation is now recognized to involve both eddies and larger-scale flows with dominant elements and their interactions varying among the classical gyres, the boundary current regions, the Southern Ocean, and the tropics.},

            Diapycnal mixing plays a primary role in the thermodynamic balance of the ocean and, consequently, in oceanic heat and carbon uptake and storage. Though observed mixing rates are on average consistent with values required by inverse models, recent attention has focused on the dramatic spatial variability, spanning several orders of magnitude, of mixing rates in both the upper and deep ocean. Away from ocean boundaries, the spatiotemporal patterns of mixing are largely driven by the geography of generation, propagation, and dissipation of internal waves, which supply much of the power for turbulent mixing. Over the last 5 years and under the auspices of U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR), a National Science Foundation (NSF)- and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-supported Climate Process Team has been engaged in developing, implementing, and testing dynamics-based parameterizations for internal wave{\textendash}driven turbulent mixing in global ocean models. The work has primarily focused on turbulence 1) near sites of internal tide generation, 2) in the upper ocean related to wind-generated near inertial motions, 3) due to internal lee waves generated by low-frequency mesoscale flows over topography, and 4) at ocean margins. Here, we review recent progress, describe the tools developed, and discuss future directions.},

	abstract = {Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.},
