# GroupExpectations
This repo holds the group expectation document for [wenegrat.github.io](https://wenegrat.github.io/)

The file `WenegratGroupExpectations.tex` contains all the content of the document. The other
documents are simply auxiliary LaTeX files needed to perform the compilation and generate the PDF document
`WenegratGroupExpectations.pdf` which will finally go on the [group website](https://wenegrat.github.io/).

Simply submitting change to the `.tex` file does not generate an updated PDF. That has to be done
locally. Some instructions on how to compile a `LaTeX` document can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler#LaTeX_editors).
